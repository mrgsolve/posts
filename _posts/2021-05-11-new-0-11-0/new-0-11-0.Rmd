# Dynamic capture

This is one of my favorite new features. I've written about it before, but as 
a review: we added a `capture` argument to `mread()` so you can opt in to 
capture additional model variables in the simulated output.

For example, let's look at this model:

```{r}
mod <- modlib("irm1")
outvars(mod)
```

You can see the compartments (`cmt`) and other model variables that are 
getting captured (`capture`). 


## See model variables

We can now look into the model and see which variables are available to capture.
First, coerce `mod` to a `list()` and then look at the `cpp_variables` item:

```{r}
cpp_variables <- as.list(mod)$cpp_variables
cpp_variables

```

This tells us what we **could** capture. Now that we have the information, 
let's capture everything possible:

```{r}
mod <- modlib("irm1", capture = cpp_variables$var)
```

Now, everything is getting captured:

```{r}
outvars(mod)
```
and will appear in the simulated output:

```{r}
mrgsim(mod, events = ev(amt = 100), param = list(VMAX  = 2))
```

In this example, we could choose from a bunch of pre-processor directives, but 
the only reason for that is this is the way the model was coded. We can look at
another example:

```{r}
mod <- modlib("pbpk")
as.list(mod)$cpp_variables %>% head()
```

## Why would I use this???

Here's an example: I have a covariate model going and I want to get parameter
values given some covariates. I can write:

```{r}
mod <- modlib("popex", capture = "CL,V,KA") %>% zero_re()

idata <- tibble(WT = seq(40,140,5))

mrgsim(mod, idata = idata, end = -1)
```

Now, I have `CL`, `V` and `KA` all calculated as a function of `WT`.


# Simulate with negative times

Until `0.11.0`, it was an error whenever negative times were requested in the 
simulation.  Now, negative times are accepted without error.Keep in mind that the 
data set still needs to be sorted by time when passing `data`.

As an example:

```{r}
mod <- modlib("irm2") %>% param(KOUT = 0.05)

sims <- 
  mod %>% 
  ev(amt = 100, ii = 48, addl = 1) %>% 
  mrgsim(start = -72, end = 240) 

sims

plot(sims, "EV1 CP RESP")
```

# Path to NM results using NMEXT and NMXML 

This is pretty subtle issue but I've grown very sensitive to it recently and 
decided we needed to change this. 

When you use the `$NMEXT` or `$NMXML` blocks, you are asking `mrgsolve` to 
import `THETA`, `OMEGA` and / or `SIGMA` from a completed NONMEM run. And 
we need to specify the path to those results. 

So far, we have had you typically specify the path relative to the 
**current working directory**. This was ok, but problems happened if you wanted
to use the model from a different working directory (you'd get an error). 

So we added an argument called `root` to `$NMEXT` and `$NMXML` that lets you 
change how that path is interpreted. 

## Root path 

The current default behavior is to interpret the path relative to the 
current working directory:

```{cpp, eval = FALSE}
[ nmext ] 
run = 1001
project = "../model/nonmem"
```

This is equivalent to invoking the new `root` argument and setting it to 
`"working"`:

```{cpp, eval = FALSE}
[ nmext ] 
run = 1001
project = "../model/nonmem"
root = "working"
```

**I am encouraging you** to start setting this `root` argument to `"cppfile"`
which tells mrgsolve to interpret the path relative to wherever the 
model code is located:

```{cpp, eval = FALSE}
[ nmext ] 
run = 1001
project = "../model/nonmem"
root = "cppfile"
```

When you do this, you can load this model from any working directory as 
long as the file remains in the same location. I am encouraging you to start 
using this because I think we will eventually make `"cppfile"` the default
root because it makes so much more sense.

Note that you can always specify an absolute path here and in that case, it 
doesn't matter what you use for the `root` argument (see the discussion on 
`here()` in the following section).


__With here()__

Some are also using the `here::here()` function. This is totally independent 
of any `mrgsolve` functionality, but `here()` will return the absolute path 
relative to your `Rstudio` project root. So, if all my models were in the 
`model/nonmem` directory, I can always get the absolute path using `here()` 
regardless of the working directory and regardless of where the `cpp` file 
is located. 

```{cpp, eval = FALSE}
[ nmext ] 
run = 1001
project = here::here("model/nonmem")
```

Note here that the argument / options here are evaluated by the R interpreter
so that the `here()` call resolves to the correct project directory.


## Select table number in NMEXT

The `[ nmext ]` block gains an index argument that will let you select which 
table in the `.ext` file to import from when there are multiple. 

- the default is `last`
- otherwise, pass an integer (e.g. 1 for first, 3 for 3rd)
- see the `?nmext` help topic for more info on this and other argument / options
  for the `nmxml` block

To select the 2nd table:

```{cpp, eval = FALSE}
[ nmext ] 
run = 1001
project = "../model/nonmem"
root = "cppfile"
index = 2 
```

The default is to select the `last` table:

```{cpp, eval = FALSE}
[ nmext ] 
run = 1001
project = "../model/nonmem"
root = "cppfile"
index = "last" // "first"
```

## Reveal results file

When you import nonmem results from an `.ext` file (via `[nmext]`) or an `.xml`
file (via `[nmxml]`), the source file is now saved in the model object so that 
it can be checked later. 

The internal model library contains an embedded nonmem run numbered `1005`; this
run imports `THETA`, `OMEGA` and `SIGMA` from a finished nonmem run. You can 
load this model with the `modlib()` function.

```{r}
mod <- modlib("1005")
```

By coercing the model to list and checking the `nm_import` item, you'll get a 
character vector with the full (absolute) path to either the `.ext` or `.xml`
file that was imported from

```{r}
as.list(mod)$nm_import
```


# Programmatic block initialization

I don't expect you'll be using this much but when you need it it will come in 
handy.

For example, let's say you wanted to write a model with a 30 x 30 omega matrix. 
This would be a pain to code given the current syntax for `$OMEGA`. I recently
refactored and standardized the way you can initialize this block 
programmatically.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
code <- '
$OMEGA @as_object
matrix(0, nrow = 30, ncol = 30)
'
mod <- mcode("omega", code, compile = FALSE)

omat(mod)
```

We didn't run the code because the screen would fill up, but you can try it. 
You will see that `$OMEGA` is a 30 x 30 matrix and it was easy to code. 
Obviously, you'll have to update this with all the elements but we have given 
you the ability to easily initialize this matrix. 

In the example, we used the `@as_object` directive. The other way to do it would
be to create the object in `$ENV` and then use `@object`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
$ENV
foo <- matrix(0, nrow = 30, ncol = 30)

$OMEGA @object foo
```

With this approach, use `@object` and then name the object that you want to 
use to populate the block. 

Other blocks that you can use this programmatic initialization:

- `$SIGMA` - return a matrix
- `$CMT` - return a character vector of compartment names
- `$INIT`  - return a named list
- `$PARAM` - return a named list
- `$THETA` - return a numeric vector
- `$FIXED` - return a named list

For example:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
code <- '
$PARAM @as_object
x <- seq(1,26)
names(x) <- letters
as.list(x)
'
mod <- mcode("letters", code, compile = FALSE)
param(mod)
```

# Check User Interrupt

Starting with version `0.11.1`, we will start periodically checking for the 
user interrupt signal (`Esc` or `Control-C`) as the simulation proceeds. This 
will let you kill a long-running simulation mid-stream. You can change the check 
interval by the `interrupt` argument to `mrgsim()`. Reduce the number to 
check more frequently and pass `-1` to not check at all.
