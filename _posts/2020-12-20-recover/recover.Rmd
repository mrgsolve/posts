title: "Recover non-numeric data columns from data/idata sets"
description: |
  For a long time, we've had `carry_out`, which copies numeric input data set 
  items into your simulated output. Now, `recover` does the same thing but will
  carry any data type from the input to output data.

We frequently want to access in the simulated output data items that were 
present in input data sets. For example, if we have multiple studies represented
in the data, we'd like to simulate all studies and then summarize or plot the 
results by study.  We need to study number in the simulated output to do that.

For a long time, mrgsolve has had a `carry_out` feature, where input data columns
can be selected and those input data automatically copied to the simulated
(output) data. However, this has been limited to numeric data items.

Starting with mrgsolve version `0.10.4`, users can bring non-numeric data items 
from input data to output. This feature is called `recover`.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = '.')
library(pmplots)
library(yspec)
```

# Example - event objects

```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(mrgsolve)

mod <- house(delta = 0.1, end = 96, outvars = "CP")
```

As a very simple example, we'll make an event object with a regimen item in 
it

```{r}
qd <- ev_rx("100 q24 x3") %>% mutate(regimen = "100 mg qd")

qd
```

When I simulate with this event object, I'll `recover` the `regimen` item

```{r}
out <- mrgsim(mod, qd, recover = "regimen")
```

I now have the "regimen" in the simulated output as a `character` data item:

```{r}
plot(out, CP ~ time |regimen)
```

```{r}
as_tibble(out)
```


Now, make another group and simulate together

```{r}
bid <- ev_rx("50 q12 x6") %>% mutate(regimen = "50 mg bid")

data <- as_data_set(bid,qd) 
```


I'm going to turn this into a  factor now ...

```{r}
data <- mutate(data, regimen = fct_inorder(regimen))
data
```

... so that when I summarize, the levels are in the order I want:

```{r}
out <- mrgsim(mod, data, recover = "regimen") 

out %>%
  group_by(regimen) %>% 
  summarise(Cmax = max(CP))
```

```{r}
plot(out, CP~time|regimen, scales="same", col = "black")
```


# Example - data set

There is no real change if I'm using `recover` with a data set

```{r,include = FALSE}
data <- ys_help$data() 
spec <- ys_help$spec()
data <- yspec_add_factors(data,spec)
data <- mutate(data, RENAL = RF_f,HEPATIC=CP_f, STUDY = STUDY_f)
data <- mutate(data, C_f = NULL,RF_f = NULL, CP_f = NULL, STUDY_f = NULL)
```

```{r}
head(data)
```

Same idea as we had in event object


```{r, message = FALSE}
out <- mrgsim(mod, data, recover = "WT,CRCL,STUDY,HEPATIC,RENAL")
```

We copy either numeric, character, or factors into the output

```{r}
as_tibble(out)
```

And we can summarize

```{r}
out %>% 
  filter(TIME < 24) %>%
  group_by(STUDY,HEPATIC,RENAL) %>%
  summarise(Cmax = max(CP))
```

```{r}
sims <- as_tibble(out)

ggplot(sims, aes(TIME,CP,group=ID)) + 
  facet_grid(STUDY~RENAL) + 
  geom_line() + theme_bw()
```

# What is the difference: carry_out / recover

There should not be a difference in the simulation result whether you use
`carry_out` or `recover` (outside of the fact that `recover` takes any type 
of data).  

There will be a very minor performance hit for using `recover` because it has to
join the input data on to the simulated data. But this should be imperceptible
in the vast majority of cases. Of course, when every microsecond of simulation
time counts, think carefully about what you are doing and consider more
efficient alternatives. Remember that features like `carry_out` and `recover`
are convenience features to make you life easier.  They always increase the
overall simulation time to some degree or another.  So when benchmarking
mrgsolve, you should always consider if `carry_out` or `recover` are being 
used or not.

`recover` depends on `carry_out` functionality to work: under the hood, we label
the input data rows with an index number, `carry_out` that index, and then use
that index to join input to output data.  So `carry_out` won't go away. But I'm
guessing that recover will be fine for most applications.

Going forward, I will be adding other convenience functions around `recover`
and working to make it a more convenient part of your workflow.
